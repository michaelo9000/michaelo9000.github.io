          One piece of coal removed from a mountain does not flatten the
          mountain. The next doesn’t either. But somewhere down the line the
          removal of a single piece will cross a threshold to where the mountain
          can no longer be called a mountain, and its ability to threaten lives
          is subdued.

                Almost 2 tonnes. NZ’s electricity is 85% from clean sources. An

                This is not to say, “don’t fly”. See your loved ones. Make
                important occasions. If you can call into that work meeting, do.
                If you’d be just as happy on a beach Ōhope as in Adelaide,
                you’ll save some money too.

              <li>
                By far the best thing you can do. You could withdraw your full
                6.58 tonnes of CO₂ per year but, as you and I both know, that
                will have little impact. Bringing the conversation about
                emissions into the open can have a butterfly effect that changes
                behaviours throughout your community. You will most likely find,
                as I have, that your friends feel very similarly to you and are
                open to changing.
