        <h1>WHAT IS AN ENGINE?</h1>
        <p>
          Your car is an engine that burns the black blood of the earth and
          expels CO₂.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you drive an SUV,

          >
          for the benefits you enjoy in comfort and status.
        </p>
        <p>
          The economy is an engine that propels the lifestyles of the wealthy.
        </p>
        <p>
          Off your back they fuel the engines of their oversized cars,
          airplanes, cruise ships, and gas burners to heat their enormous
          houses.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is these engines that I propose are turned off, for the sake of the
          billions who would suffer unmitigated global warming. These, and the
          engines at the control of principled people as they park across petrol
          station entry ways, in CBD streets, and over Fonterra tanker
          entrances.

        <p>
          11% of New Zealand's emissions are caused by cars. These emissions are

          Having done business before climate change was much of a
          consideration, this group made its fortune by recklessly emitting and
          shaping the way we live - that cemented way of life which we are
          currently fighting to dissolve for the sake of future generations in
          New Zealand and on earth.
